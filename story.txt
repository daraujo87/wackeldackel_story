Much like every other Wednesday night, I finished my Apfelkuchen, strapped on my lederhosen, and I was ready to go.
Even though I had not washed my BMW since going off roading I still decided I needed to go see the Rammstein.
Who cares if the car is dirty, I just need klimaanlage and I'm good to go.
On the way I stopped at the Biergarten to prepare my mind for the music in solemn meditation.
While in meditation I thought about my Hund Alfred who had recently run into a baeckerei on hauptstrasse and ate all the gebaecks.
After downing a couple of steins I headed to the concert which was being held at an old schloss near Raesfeld.
I arrived at the concert and I was about to head in, but I just couldn't resist the smells of the Baeckerei just outside the venue.
So after some contemplation I decided to go order some Gebaeck and Brot for later on in the evening.
Tempted also by the food truck outside I got in line to order a Bratwurst to complement my meal.
Unfortunately they were all out of Bratwurst so I decided to just get an Apfelkuchen.
As I went to pay the eltz that live in the schloss offered to pay for me, sehr sch√∂n.
After the concert the eltz and I decided to go to a ratskeller for a few beers and shoot some pool.
And that's the story of how a Doener like me got to ride in a Porsche.
P.S. If anyone could give me a lift to Hauptstrasse, my BMW is still there.
